# Wordle

Simple word guessing game in PT-BR.

The project was all thought out and developed in the same afternoon at once, so the commit history is simplistic.

The idea is to imitate games already present in app stores but with really challenging words even for native Portuguese speakers.

## How to play

#### Mode 1

A person holds the cell phone and tries to describe the word using synonyms or trying to describe it.
Another person (or n people) tries to guess the word.
The user can record a hit or skip the word.

#### Mode 2 (if there is difficulty)*

One person holds the cell phone and reads the description of the word to the others who need to guess the meaning of that word.

## Misc

The Portuguese language has more than 370k words, among them, many that have never been heard by any of the players, so the game can become very challenging.

There is also the option to "Play offline" so that the game is not hampered by flaws in the API used. In this case, there is an initial set of 150 words generated by ChatGPT.
